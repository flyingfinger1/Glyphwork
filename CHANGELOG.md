# Changelog

## 0.1.0 – first release

Clickable, pixel-positioned GUIs inside the vanilla dialog screen for Paper 26.3. No client mod;
players only need the resource pack that Glyphwork generates and sends itself.

### Plugin

- **Scene API** (`glyphwork-api`): panels (any tile shape), labels, buttons, invisible hitboxes,
  lists and grids with automatic paging, tooltips, tint colors, per-player state, navigation
  (`reopen`, `open`, `back`, `close`) and text input through a small native dialog. Other plugins
  depend on Glyphwork and compile against the API jar. See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md).
- **Exact clicks:** everything is clickable exactly where it is drawn, also off the 9 px text grid
  (verified against the 26.3 client's hit test).
- **Skins:** frames are autotiled from small A2 sheets (47 tiles per frame, any shape joins
  seamlessly). Built-in vanilla-style skin, exported to `plugins/Glyphwork/themes/vanilla/` as a
  template; own skins via `theme:` in `config.yml`. Format: [docs/skin-format.md](docs/skin-format.md).
- **Resource pack:** generated on start, byte-stable (same content, same SHA-1, no re-download),
  depends only on the skin, not on the scenes. Served by a built-in HTTP server or written to
  `plugins/Glyphwork/pack/<sha1>.zip` for external hosting (`pack.url` with `{sha1}`).
- **Fallback:** players without the pack (declined, failed, still loading) get a plain native
  dialog built from the same scene.
- **Commands:** `/glyphwork pack` (everyone), `/glyphwork test [fallback]`, `status`, `reload`
  (permission `glyphwork.admin`). Reload rebuilds theme and pack and sends it to everyone online.

### Skin editor

Browser tool at https://flyingfinger1.github.io/Glyphwork/: paint directly in a sample window
(linked quarters), generator with presets, mirroring, live preview of any shape with tint, the
plugin's demo scene, a seam view with a test shape covering all 68 quarter transitions, palettes,

### Limits

- Paper 26.3, Java 25. Dialogs exist since 1.21.6; other versions are untested.

- Scenes up to `max-height` px (default 256).
- No item icons yet (planned).
